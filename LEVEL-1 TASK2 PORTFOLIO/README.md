# Portfolio Website

I have created a personal portfolio with the basic skills in  HTML and BOOTSTRAP and CSS. This is yet again, one of the most common projects on web development for beginners. In a personal portfolio, you get to show a wide range of samples and skills and add your resume. You can add an image at the top where you can introduce yourself; below that, you can add contact information.

Tech Stack - HTML ,CSS ,JS , BOOTSTARP
